## Overview

Beveren FSM is a **100% open-source** Field Service Management app for ERPNext — simple, modern, and powerful, designed to manage end-to-end service operations.

It enables service teams to log requests, schedule jobs, assign technicians, track work on-site, manage spare parts, and invoice customers — all from a single integrated ERPNext system.

## Why Beveren FSM?

Managing field service operations can be complex — multiple service requests, technician schedules, spare parts, approvals, and customer billing all need to work together. Existing ERPNext workflows are often manual or fragmented.

Beveren FSM closes this gap, offering a streamlined, modern, and fully ERPNext-integrated solution. The app ensures real-time visibility, better control, and faster response times for service businesses of any size.

## How It Works

The Beveren FSM workflow follows a logical service lifecycle:

### Service Request
Operators log requests from customers or field teams, capturing all essential details such as issue, location, and priority.

### Service Quotation (Optional)
Create a quotation for labor, travel, and parts. Approval is optional, allowing flexibility for prepaid or contract-based services.

### Service Order
Approved requests are converted into Service Orders, the central document for tracking and executing work.

### Service Appointments & Scheduling
Create appointments from the Service Order. Schedule, assign technicians, and dispatch based on priority and availability.

### On-Site Execution
Technicians start and stop work directly from the appointment, update progress, consume parts, and log service details.

### Completion & Invoicing
Once the job is completed, the Service Order is closed and invoices can be generated directly, ensuring accurate billing and full traceability.

#### Workflow Summary
```
Service Request → Service Quotation (Optional) → Service Order → 
Service Appointments → Work Execution → Invoice
```
